# Dropbox Clone

## Introduction

I decided to build a Dropbox clone because I wanted to explore using Google Firebase, Google Firestore, and some React drag-and-drop features while also reinforcing my React fundamentals. Additionally, I recently learned about Clerk's authentication tools and was eager to see how seamlessly they could be integrated. This app was a lot of fun to build. It features full authentication, allowing you to store, rename, and delete multiple files.

## Tools Used

- **NEXT.JS 14**: A React framework for building web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Clerk**: A user authentication solution for React applications.
- **Shadcn**: A customizable component library.
- **Firebase**: A platform for building web and mobile applications.
- **Firestore**: A scalable NoSQL cloud database.
- **React Hot Toasts**: A library for displaying toasts in React.
- **Drag/Drop**: A feature for intuitive file management.
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
